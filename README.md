# BIOS-IN5410_H2021
Repository for the R lectures in BIOS-IN5410 Autumn 2021

NB! Under development. Everything may change until the last minute.

## Get started
Before the lectures, make sure that you have R and RStudio installed and working on your computer. You should first download and install R, for instance from [cran.uib.no](https://cran.uib.no/). Then you should download and install RStudio from [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (choose the Free plan).  

**NB!** If you have a computer owned by your university with a windows operating system it's a good idea to have your IT department install R and RStudio. And very important: make sure that R-packages will be installed locally and not on any remote drive (e.g. by changing the default `.libPaths()`).

When you have everything up and running it should look something like this:
