A) 
Write a for loop that iterates over the numbers 1 to 7 and prints the square (square is denoted like this: ^) of each number using print().

B) 
- Make a for loop that iterates over the column names of the dataset in *data_file_1.csv* and prints each name (`names(dataframe)` will show the column names of a dataframe).
- Change the code so that it prints the number of characters in each column name instead (`nchar()` can be useful).
- Can you combine the codes to print both the column names with the number of characters in parenthesis after each name? (`paste0()` is useful for joining strings together).
- Finally, save the results of the for loop into a vector instead of printing to screen.
