Make the same plots as in Exercise 4, but using ggplot2.

Make the same scatterplot as in Exercise 4, but use ggplot2 instead of the `plot()` function. Make sure that the data in *data_file_1.csv* is stored as an object and as a tibble.

Basic plotting

Make a scatterplot showing the relationship between gene length and count in the data located in "data_file_1.csv".
Make a histogram showing the distribution of gene counts.
Try to add different values for the "breaks = " argument to the hist() function to increase or decrease the number of bins. How does this change the histogram?
