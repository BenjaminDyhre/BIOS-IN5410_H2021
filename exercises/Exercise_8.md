## Plotting with ggplot2

Try to make the same plots as in Exercise 4, but using ggplot2.

If you're able to generate a plot, then you're done. But great if you would like to also play around by adding axis labels, plot title, colors, changing sizes, etc..

For the histogram you can try to change the number of bins with the arguments "bins" or "binwidth".  

Try to play around with adding different **themes** - see [here](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements#quick-functions-to-change-plot-themes).
